## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VICKY-0017/Child_detection_ML_model.git
   cd Child_detection_ML_model
## optional 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

jupyter notebook

## Model Details
Architecture: e.g., built with TensorFlow/Keras, 3 convolutional layers

Hyperparameters: learning rate, epochs, batch size (e.g., 0.001, 20, 32)

Results: training & validation accuracy plotted in the notebook

## Evaluation
Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Visuals: confusion matrix and ROC curve

Interpretation: highlight model strengths/weaknesses

## Error Handling & Known Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Might misclassify scenes with occlusions or lighting changes

Edge cases: partial child faces, group images
-üß© TODO: add data augmentation and deeper networks to improve robustness
